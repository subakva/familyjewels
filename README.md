Project To Do List
----------

* Improve handling of error cases
* Use whenever to set up cron scheduling
* Add tasks for cleanly generating indexes
* Helper scripts for setting up apache static index hosting
* Sinatra (or similar) to serve static indexes
* Use Bundler to isolate gem sets from the system gems
* Build binary commands
* Fill in gemspec
* Define rubygems dependencies
* Handle missing support gems (bundler, rake, builder)
* Sep. gem to provide web interface for management (add/remove/edit/schedule project builds)
* Consider whether to use rvm to manage gemsets (too much installation overhead?)
