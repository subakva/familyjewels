Project To Do List
==========

Next Up
----------

* Write automated tests to confirm functionality
* Add tasks for cleanly re-generating indexes
* Test installation build with real-world configuration
* Refactor Project#build into Builder class
* Refactor Project#register into Config class

Big List
----------

* Improve handling of error cases
* Use whenever to set up cron scheduling
* Helper scripts for setting up apache static index hosting
* Sinatra (or similar) to serve static indexes
* Build binary commands
* Fill in gemspec
* Define rubygems dependencies
* Handle missing support gems (bundler, rake, builder)
* Sep. gem to provide web interface for management (add/remove/edit/schedule project builds)

Done

* Consider whether to use rvm to manage gemsets (too much installation overhead?)
